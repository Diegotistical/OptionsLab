    "Challenges Faced During Monte Carlo Implementation:\n",
    "- When implementing the Monte Carlo simulation, I encountered several challenges, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling the zero volatility case: Initially, the code failed when sigma = 0, resulting in incorrect pricing. I solved this by adding a special case to compute deterministic prices directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance reduction effectiveness: While using antithetic variates, tuning the number of simulations to balance computation time and accuracy required multiple experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numerical stability: For very large time steps or volatility, simulated paths sometimes produced overflow errors due to exponentiation of large log-price increments. Adding input validation and limiting parameter ranges helped mitigate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance optimization: Simulating hundreds of thousands of paths took noticeable time. Vectorizing computations with NumPy improved speed, but there is still room for further optimization (e.g., using Numba or multiprocessing)."
